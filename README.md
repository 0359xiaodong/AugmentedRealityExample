AugmentedRealityExample
=======================

Developer: Pedro Vicente Gómez Sánchez.

Augmented Reality (AR) refers to the direct or indirect view of a real-world environment whose elements are blended with superimposed virtual graphics to create a mixed reality in real time. A range of technological devices which combines virtual data with the existing physical information, adding a synthetic reality to the existing world. This project it's a little example of an application for Android or iOS developed with Unity3D and Vuforia.

“Physical reality augmentation by the usage of techniques which mix digital information” Tom Caudell 1990

To use this app you have to print the target and point your phone's camera at it. Enjoy with the great 3D model in the real world. 

This project is a simple example of how create an Agmented Reality app for Android or iOS. This example has been used in a live demo to show how to build Augmented Reality Applications. There are other good examples of AugmentedReality developed by me like:
